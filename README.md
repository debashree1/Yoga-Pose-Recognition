2. Back-End Development with Spring Boot: Implemented the back-end functionality using Spring Boot, including designing APIs, managing the database of tourist spots and their closing times, and calculating optimized sequential routes.
3. GPS Integration: Integrated GPS capabilities into the application, enabling users to receive real-time navigation instructions and directions based on their current location and selected destinations.
4. Real-Time Updates: Provided users with up-to-date information on traffic conditions, estimated travel times, and any relevant alerts or notifications during their journey.
5. Customizable Itinerary: Allowed users to customize their itinerary by selecting the tourist spots they want to visit, with the application automatically adjusting the route and navigation instructions accordingly.
6. Seamless User Experience: Ensured a responsive and intuitive user experience across different devices, allowing tourists to easily navigate through the application and explore multiple tourist spots efficiently.

By combining the power of React.js, Spring Boot, and GPS integration, this project offers a comprehensive solution for tourists to plan their trips, receive real-time navigation guidance, and explore multiple tourist spots in a sequential manner, enhancing their overall travel experience.
